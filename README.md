# <My-Portofolio-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

A portofolio of my work would showcase my skills to potential employers. Thus, I decided to build this portofolio to practice recent HTML & CSS skills I learned and to test my abilities. 

This portofolio will provide potential employers with clean UI and a very professional presentation about me, as well as contact info and links to my social media and github profile. This would make it easy for employeers to assess my skills and contact me. 

I learned how to effectively build a web page out of HTML and Style it using CSS. I applied the skills I learned in the last 2 Modules such as semantic elements, flexbox, media quiries, and CSS variables.

The application is deployed on webpage X. To install it go to "github-url" and clone the repo to your local machine using the git clone command.
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Once installed, open the HTML file in VS Code and right click anywhere on the file and select Display in Default Browser. 
## How-I-Build-It

Step 1: Research 

I researched other portofolios that were built using HTML & CSS only and determined the basic structure of my portofolio and brainstormed ideas to make it unique. 

Step 2: Wireframing

I build a basic wireframe using Figma.

Step 3: Writing the code

I started by determining the folder structure. HTML file at the and a CSS and images folders nested in Assets. The images contains the portrait images and screenshots of my projects. The css contains two files reset.css to reset css to default setting and styles.css to style the page.
